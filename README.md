# COMP 4521 course project @ HKUST
UST as UST Â­- U Share Them as UST Students!

Assignment graded - under mit license.
Seems I have included the reports in the 7z files... tell me if isn't.

Feel free continue this project (with different name maybe),
Tell me for requesting any support (but not working for your course project!),
Or just do it by yourself. Obviously there are rooms for improvement.

Structure:
  As stated in the docs, Android client side, NodeJS server, JSON data formatting.
  
How to open and view those s___:
  Use Android studio to open the root directory.
  Use 7-zip to extract other files, use text editor to open js files.
  Install NodeJS, shift+right click on server directory, open cmd at directory, node server.
  If the empty database is not work, use database-test (sure rename it).
  GCM part is simple. Google and see the instruction.

Rooms for improvement:
  MongoDB commands! To give faith to the boss. (Server side)
  Mapping of IMG files is a bit too messy. See matchIMG function. (Server side)
  Insert package.json for better support of npm commands. (Server side)
  Use async task for loading CalEvents in ChatFragment. (Client side)
  Use Android's AsyncTask and HttpRequest instead of loopJ's external libraries. For style. (Client side)
  Since it moved from Ecplise to Android Studio, revise the structure, remove necessary codes, 
    also run a few more pass of code inspect. (Client side)
  Support more multimedia formats like Wha__App. (Client side)
  Continuous UI improvement please. (Client side)
  Renaming. Very important.

History:
2014 Spring: 
  Jason's group created this for course project. 
  Named Ex-UST. 1 carry, 1 deadline fighter, 1 freerider.
  Created the basic structure of Android client - Course, Calendar, Chat.
  Created server.js and download.js.
  Thought to use MongoDB. Due to XXX issues, server handle the data instead.
  Used SVN but you know, Google shut it down.
2015 Spring: 
  Darren's group continued this for course project (same course). 
  Named UasT. 1 carry, 1 deadline fighter, 1 freerider.
  Added image supporting (JPG only, hard-coded) for all components.
  Filled the huge hole of Calendar function.
  Made the js files supporting the updated external libraries (as in 2015).
  Didn't think for using MongoDB. But the review reminded me a lot.
